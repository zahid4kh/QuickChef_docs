**Privacy Policy for Quick Chef**

_Last updated: 07/11/2024

Welcome to Quick Chef! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your information when you use our mobile application, Quick Chef, which provides personalized recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you have on hand. We use the Gemini Pro AI model to generate recipes and provide an option for users to sign in with their Google account. 

**1. Information Collection and Use**

* **Ingredients Input**  
When you use Quick Chef to generate recipes, we collect the ingredients you enter to provide relevant recipe suggestions. We do not store this information; it is processed locally on your device or transmitted directly to Gemini Pro for recipe generation, and it is not retained after your session.

* **Google Sign-In**  
If you choose to sign in with Google, Quick Chef collects only the information necessary for account authentication, as permitted by Google’s privacy and data policy. This may include your name, email address, and Google profile ID. We do not collect or store any additional personal information beyond what Google provides.

* **Usage Data**  
We may collect certain data to help us understand how you use Quick Chef. This data may include information about your device (e.g., device type, operating system), as well as app usage data (e.g., features accessed, session duration). This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to identify you personally. We use this data to improve the app’s performance and user experience.

**2. Data Sharing and Disclosure**

* **Third-Party Service Providers**  
We use the Gemini Pro API to process your ingredient inputs and generate recipe suggestions. This data is sent directly to Gemini Pro solely for the purpose of providing recipe recommendations. Gemini Pro may have its own privacy practices, and we encourage you to review its privacy policy as well.

* **Compliance with Laws**  
We may disclose your information if required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.

**3. Data Retention**

We do not retain any personal data related to your ingredient inputs or Google sign-in information beyond the scope of the active session.

**4. Security**

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data and safeguard against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**5. Children’s Privacy**

Quick Chef is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, and if we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes, which will be effective upon posting.
